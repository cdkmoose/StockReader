# StockReader
This is a small app for retrieving stock pricing data.  It originated with a question from my mother-in-law about
how to get prices for a list of stocks without actually telling anybody on that nasty internet what her favorite stocks were.
It uses Yahoo finance as data source and can be configured to ping for updates on an interval.  As she asked more questions, 
I added more data and features.  

It's nothing special but I think it could be a handy little app you can run on your PC as long as you have an internet 
connection.  It's still a work in progress as I field more questions from her or get random ideas of nice possible features.  It
minimizes to the system tray so it stays out of your way while you're using your computer.

This is not intended to be a true investing tool, but who knows where we'll end up as I add more features.

Written in C# and no special libraries are required.
